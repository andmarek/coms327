OPAL's Playable Almost Indefectibly. Get flag info using ./opal.out -h.

The monster and object parsing is implemented in Yacc and (F)Lex, so compilation
requires them.

For this version only, the program will halt after parsing the monster and
object files. This can be bypassed with '-c'.

Requires support for C++17 and POSIX threads.
